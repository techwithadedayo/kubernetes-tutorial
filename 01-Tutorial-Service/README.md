ðŸ”¹ What is a Service?
A Service in Kubernetes is a logical abstraction that defines a policy to access a set of Pods. It provides a stable IP address and DNS name, even as pods are replaced or scaled.

ðŸ“Œ Why use Services?
Pods have dynamic IPs â€” Services provide stable networking.

Enables load balancing between multiple pod replicas.

Decouples client apps from pod details.

Note: Please substitute manifest file names where appropriate
