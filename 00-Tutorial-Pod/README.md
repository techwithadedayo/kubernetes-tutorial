ðŸ”¹ What is a Pod?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents a single instance of a running process in your cluster.

You can think of a Pod as a wrapper around one or more containers (usually one), with shared resources like storage, network, and configuration.

ðŸ“Œ Why use Pods?
Encapsulates one or more tightly coupled containers.

Ensures containers inside a pod can communicate via localhost.

Shares storage volumes and network IP.

Ideal when two containers must run together (e.g., app + sidecar).

Note: Please substitute manifest file names where appropriate
