1. ReplicaSet
Purpose: A ReplicaSet ensures that a specified number of identical pod replicas are running at any given time. If a pod fails or is deleted, the ReplicaSet will create a new pod to maintain the specified number of replicas.

Key Features:

Ensures high availability by running a set of identical pods.

Manages the scaling of pods (up or down).

Does not handle upgrades or rolling updates of the pods.

Limitations:

ReplicaSets only manage replicas and cannot control the versioning or upgrades of the pods. They donâ€™t provide declarative updates to the pod configurations.

You cannot manage deployment lifecycle events like rolling updates, rollbacks, or version management directly with ReplicaSets.


Note: Please substitute manifest file names where appropriate

| Action              | Command                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Create a ReplicaSet | `kubectl apply -f replicaset.yaml`      |
| List ReplicaSets    | `kubectl get rs`                        |
| Describe ReplicaSet | `kubectl describe rs <replicaset-name>` |
| Delete ReplicaSet   | `kubectl delete rs <replicaset-name>`   |


#Pods and Replicasets are loosley coupled.
# this will delete the rs and the pods will become orphans with no self healing and no autoscaling capabilities.
kubectl delete rs my-app-replicaset --cascade=orphan
